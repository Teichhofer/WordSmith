# AGENTS

Guidelines for coding agents working on this repository:

- Every code change must include corresponding tests.
- Run `pytest` and ensure all tests pass before committing.
- Avoid adding external dependencies without discussion.
- Generated artifacts like logs/ and output/ are ignored by git.
